# Eat-Da-Burger


## About
This is a burger logger that utilizes MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. It follows the MVC design pattern and makes use of Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML presented in the view.

## How to Use
This app is a single page where the user can enter or "log" burgers he/she wishes to eat. When the user clicks on the "Devour!" button next to each burger, it puts the respective burger into the right column, signifying it was already eaten.
